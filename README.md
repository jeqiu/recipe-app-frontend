<h2>Quick-Picks Recipe App</h2>

This is a fullstack web app that suggests a random recipe for users who want to try cooking something new. 

The app currently has 2 main functions, the first of which is retrieving a random recipe using the Spoonacular API, with an option to exclude any ingredients the user is allergic to. The app also allows users to save interesting recipes to the connected PostgreSQL database so they can come back to them later.
